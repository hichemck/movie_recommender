# Movie Recommender Project

In this project I used movie ratings data from [Movielens](https://movielens.org/) to build 
my own recommender system with different methods/models.

[Data Source](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)

# Work Breakdown 

- download the movielens data
- create a user-item matrix
- implement the following recommender methods
    - DummyRecommender (recommend a random movie)
    - GlobalRecommender (recommend the most popular movies)
    - Non Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
    - Collaborative Filtering
- create a Flask Web App and a Web Form where the user can choose between different recommendation techniques
